# Locations

Playing around with parsing JSON data. Wrote a simple PHP script to connect to DB and parse data to JSON. 

This is just the start of the application. There is no point to it other than practice and for fun! 

## What It Does
Locations is just my little application that I’m going to fill with Locations. Table view full of different places and when you click on them, it will open up a detail view to show the address of that location. 


Sadly, **It’s Broken!** - sort of. It crashes and I’m still working through some stuff to get it to work the way I want it to work.
